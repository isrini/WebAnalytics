Kill Your Darlings is a 2006 film directed by Björne Larson and written by Björne Larson and Johan Sandström. In an interview with Svenska Dagbladet, Larson said that the film is based on a real event in his life when he met a seemingly nice man at an internet cafe in Los Angeles who ended up leaving Larson bound and restrained in a desert.[1] The film features a cast of many of the most popular contemporary Swedish actors (Fares Fares, father and son Stellan and Alexander Skarsgård, and Andreas Wilson from Oscar-nominated Evil) and some less famous U.S. actors Julie Benz and Greg Germann, and Canadian Lolita Davidovitch. The title seems to be a reference to the popular advice for writers, "Murder your darlings," commonly misattributed but written by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch.[2]
