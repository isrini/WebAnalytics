Where the Money Is is a 2000 film directed by Marek Kanievska, written by E. Max Frye, and starring Paul Newman, Linda Fiorentino, and Dermot Mulroney. This was the next-to-last screen appearance by Newman in his long career in feature films, followed by Road to Perdition.Professional thief Henry Manning is in an Oregon nursing home's care. Having suffered a massive stroke, he is immobile and mute. Henry is in the care of Carol Ann McKay, a high school prom queen who married her boyfriend Wayne, the star of her school's football team, and whose glamour days are well behind her.Carol Ann starts to suspect that Henry isn't as sick as he seems. She attempts to get a rise out of him by doing a lap dance, but fails. So convinced is she that Henry is faking, she gives him the ultimate test, pushing Henry and his wheelchair off a pier into the water, defying him to swim or die.Preferring this place to prison, Harry had studied yoga as a way to fake the symptoms of a stroke. Exposed as a fraud, Henry is at least relieved to be able to walk and talk again. Soon he is dancing and drinking with Carol Ann and Wayne at a local bar, then coaxing them to be his accomplices in his last and greatest score, an armored transport heist. Carol Ann is bored and goes along with the heist, which doesn't go as smoothly as she had hoped.
