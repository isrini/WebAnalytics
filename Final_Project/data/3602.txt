Repentance is a 2013 psychological thriller film directed by Philippe Caland and starring Forest Whitaker, Anthony Mackie, Mike Epps, Nicole Ari Parker and Sanaa Lathan. Repentance is the first major film production of CodeBlack Films since CodeBlack's merger with Lions Gate Entertainment in May 2012.[2] The film had its limited release in US theaters on February 28, 2014.[3]   Years after a drunken car crash that almost took his life, Tommy Carter (Mackie) has reinvented himself as a therapist/spiritual advisor who advocates a synthesis of world religions and positivity. He's parlayed this vocation into a successful book release that one day draws the attention of Angel Sanchez (Whitaker), a profoundly troubled man fixated on the "untimely" death of his mother. When Carter takes on Sanchez as a personal client in an effort to raise funds for his indebted brother Ben (Epps), things quickly take a turn for the worse. Angel needs much more than a simple life coach. Then begin madness and horror. Repentance opened on February 28, 2014 in limited release. The film's opening weekend gross was $501,290 in 152 North American theaters (a per theater average of $3,298).[4] The film remained in theaters in limited release for 4 weeks, earning $1,189,612 in its entire run. Repentance was available on Digital HD and Video on Demand on June 10, 2014 and was released on Blu-Ray and DVD on June 24, 2014.[5][6]
