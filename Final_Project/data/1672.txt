...So Goes The Nation is a 2006 political documentary that follows the 2004 United States presidential election between John Kerry and George W. Bush, concentrating on the battleground state of Ohio. The film interviews campaign workers on both sides and analyzes the outcome of the results. The name comes from the saying that "As Ohio goes, so goes the nation". In 2004, Ohio swung the election, and in fact no Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio. The documentary focused heavily on the rural-urban divide in Ohio, and the corresponding cultural and moral issues which, according to the documentary, played a pivotal role in the election.
