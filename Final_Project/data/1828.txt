Darfur Now premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival.[2] The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 2, 2007.   Darfur Now follows the story of six individuals, who are tied together by the same cause: the crisis in Darfur. These individuals include Don Cheadle, an Oscar-nominated actor using his celebrity status to draw attention to the issue, as well as Adam Sterling, a 24-year-old waiter and activist urging Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign a bill to keep California funds from investing in companies with interests in Sudan, and Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. Then there's the ones actually situated in Darfur: Hejewa Adam, a woman whose baby was beaten to death by Janjaweed attackers who now fights in the Sudanese Liberation Army; Ahmed Mohammed Abakar, a displaced builder and farmer who now serves as leader and head sheikh of a camp of 47,000 other displaced Darfurians; and Pablo Recalde, leader of the World Food Program in West Darfur.
