Jenn Eblin wrote on reviewstream.com, "If you’re thinking of a way to waste an hour and a half of your life, give the movie Knock Knock a try. This movie is a complete waste of time and I don’t know how I ever sat through the whole movie." "I can handle a movie if it has a bad plot, bad acting, bad characters, a bad ending, or even bad lighting and sets. Unfortunately I can’t handle all of those things at one time in the same movie, which is what I ended up with here."[1]
