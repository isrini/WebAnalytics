Everything seemed fine until Anna started to develop a fixation with John as the pregnancy moved further along. Anna's growing obsession interferes with what was a plan by her and her boyfriend, Mike, to scam the couple by demanding money. When Mike pushes Anna to demand money, she kills him. The family found themselves toying with Anna whose psychotic and dangerous fixation with the soon-to-be father also moved along to become a deadly obsession.
