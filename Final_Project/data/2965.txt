Border Run (earlier title The Mule) is a 2012 American mystery thriller film produced by Lucas Jarach and directed by Gabriela Tagliavini. The film is based on true events and was released on DVD in February 2013. Stone portrays journalist Sofie Talbert, a hard-hitting journalist against illegal immigration to the United States. Learning that her brother in Mexico has gone missing, she goes to find him and uncovers the brutal reality of the desperate people who risk their lives to cross into the States. The film also points out that some illegals are twice-removed from their country of origin, crossing from Central America into Mexico first, which is equally hazardous. Border Run earned a nomination for Best Feature Film at the 2013 Imagen Foundation Awards. Inspired by true events, Sharon Stone stars as an American reporter (Sofie) who searches for her missing brother. The film depicts human smuggling across the United States/Mexican border.
