Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic is a 2005 comedy written by and starring Sarah Silverman, directed by Liam Lynch and distributed by Roadside Attractions. The movie is a concert film consisting of 72 minutes of clips taken from Silverman's previous stand-up show of the same name, interspersed with flashbacks and comedic sketches. Silverman addresses a number of topics, including religion, AIDS, the Holocaust, race, sexism, political parties, people with disabilities, homeless people, and dwarves. Silverman also performs several original songs in the film.[2] The film was released November 11, 2005 in eight theatres. Receiving positive reviews, it made just under $125,000 during opening weekend. Its performance led to an expanded release in as many as 57 theatres, resulting in a box office take of more than $1.2 million. The movie was released on DVD on June 6, 2006 in the United States, June 13 in Canada, and October 13, 2008 in the United Kingdom. A soundtrack CD was also released featuring most of the musical numbers, excerpts from Silverman's stand-up comedy, and several additional songs which did not appear in the film.[citation needed] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, "Most of the humor in "Jesus Is Magic" depends on the scandal of hearing a nice, middle-class Jewish girl make jokes about rape, anal sex, the Holocaust and AIDS. She makes fun of religion. She riffs on 9/11. But Ms. Silverman is not smashing taboos so much as she is desperately searching for them."[3]
