Noah Cruise (Wesley Jonathan) is a naturally talented basketball player who receives an athletic scholarship to UCLA after the death of his mother where he moves to the suburbs. Although he is a skilled player, Cruise wishes to use his scholarship to obtain a career in the medical field. He has to deal with external forces that come with his talent, most notably pushy sports agent Vaughn (Wayne Brady) and his two best friends Tech (Anthony Mackie) and Up (Lil' JJ). Vaughn pressures Cruise to pursue a career in professional sports, while Tech, also a basketball prodigy, dreams of beating his rival Jewelz (Champion) in a streetball competition. Tech is also struggling to obtain his GED to move past his Detroit surroundings and an assault charge that he took to protect Cruise. The friends meet two women along the way, Vanessa (Eva Pigford) and Eboni (Alecia Fears), and they head to Los Angeles on a trip that will change their lives forever.
