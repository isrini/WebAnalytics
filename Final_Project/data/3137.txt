Red Hook Summer is a 2012 American film co-written and directed by Spike Lee. It is Lee's sixth film in his "Chronicles of Brooklyn" series following She's Gotta Have It, Do the Right Thing, Crooklyn, Clockers, and He Got Game.[2]   Flik Royale is a 13-year-old boy from Atlanta who is sent to live with his preacher grandfather, Da Good Bishop Enoch Rouse, in Red Hook, Brooklyn.[3] Spike Lee reprises his role as Mookie, the main character from his 1989 film Do the Right Thing.[4] Principal photography lasted three weeks, "on a small budget, guerrilla-style, like Lee's first feature film."[5] Red Hook Summer marked the first time that Lee has acted in one of his films since Summer of Sam (1999). A 135-minute version of Red Hook Summer was previewed at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival;[6] The film was released on August 10, 2012, in select theaters of the New York City area[7] and was released in Los Angeles and other parts of the United States on August 24, 2012.[8] The film reached 41 theaters at its peak.[1] The film was released on home video on December 21, 2012.[9] Peter Debruge of Variety said "It's fiery, passionate stuff, at times inelegantly presented, but impossible to ignore."[10] Roger Ebert gave the film  (2Â½ out of four stars) saying it "plays as if the director is making it up as he goes along. That's not entirely a bad thing, although some will be thrown off-balance by an abrupt plot development halfway through that appears entirely out of the blue and is so shocking that the movie never really recovers. Here is Lee at his most spontaneous and sincere, but he could have used another screenplay draft."[5]
