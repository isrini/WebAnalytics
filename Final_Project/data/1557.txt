Everyone depicted in the film plays as themselves. All nine main cast members from the first film returned for the sequel.

The film premiered in theatres on September 22, 2006. The DVD was later released on December 26, 2006. Jackass 2.5, a direct-to-video feature, was made available online on December 19, 2007 and on DVD on December 26, 2007.[1] It contains most of the deleted and unused scenes that were originally shot for Jackass Number Two. The film received positive reviews from critics, and was also a box-office success, making nearly $85 million worldwide against a production budget of only $11.5 million.   Jackass Number Two is a compilation of various stunts, pranks and skits. The film opens with an introduction of the primary cast members as they are being chased by bulls in a suburban neighborhood. Stunts include interacting with animals such as snakes, sharks, bees and bulls; eating biological waste; intaking or expelling various liquids and items; walking around in public with exposed sagging breasts or prosthetic testicles; launching themselves with rocket-propelled apparatuses over a lake, and many activities involving bodily harm. The film involves participation from various guest stars. In one of the skits, Mat Hoffman and Tony Hawk throw pendulums at the guys as they try to skate across. In another, Ehren McGhehey pretends to be an airport terrorist until the taxi driver, played by Jay Chandrasekhar, turns on him.[2] The movie finishes with Johnny Knoxville sticking his hand into a bear trap and a Busby Berkeley-style movie musical production number set to the La Cage aux Folles song "The Best of Times", where the guys sing and dance while performing more stunts. The entire main cast from Jackass: The Movie returned for the sequel. The film also includes cameos by Brandon Novak, Mark Zupan, Brandon DiCamillo, Roger Alan Wade, Dimitry Elyashkevich, Loomis Fall, Lance Bangs, animal experts David Weathers and Manny Puig, Rick Kosick, Spike Jonze and cult film directors John Waters, Jay Chandrasekhar. Professional BMX rider Mat Hoffman and professional skater Tony Hawk both performed stunts. Rap group Three 6 Mafia also appears, as well as HIM singer Ville Valo, rapper Lil Wayne, actor James DeBello, with Kat Von D, as well as NFL star Jason Taylor. Mike Judge, Luke Wilson and Willie Garson are also featured in the credits and in deleted scenes. Stunts including Jackass and Viva La Bam regular Don Vito were also filmed and shown in previews. However, due to the scandal surrounding his arrest just prior to the film's release and the nature of the charges against him, all the scenes involving Don Vito were cut. Shooting began on January 30, 2006 and ended on June 23, 2006.[3][4] The Jackass cast refused to divulge where they were filming, out of fear of fans interfering with the filming process. However, they have filmed in India, Australia, England, Moscow and Argentina. A few insights were leaked prior to the movie's release by Steve-O and Bam Margera via Radio Bam and Loveline. Other shootings were Bull Shoals, Arkansas; Key West, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; and West Chester, Pennsylvania. The stunt "How to Milk a Horse" was originally shot for Wildboyz, but was saved for future use.[5] "The idea to drink the horse semen was not actually planned but was "in the back of everyone's mind."[6] To agree to do the stunt, Chris Pontius asked director Jeff Tremaine for a full day off of work, but discouraged doing so since Pontius had missed work the day before.[7] Additionally on screen Chris Pontius stated to Jeff Tremaine "This is going to make up for something bad I'm going to do in the future." This deal was verbally agreed upon and sealed with a handshake; it was also noted that said deal was videotaped for the camera. The film had 4 different screenings for fans of Jackass and MySpace users, which was a part of MySpace's "Black Carpet" screening. The screenings took place a few days before the movie was released (possibly August). Some of the screenings also had surprise visits by cast and crew. For example, the Pennsylvania screening had director Jeff Tremaine and cast members Johnny Knoxville and Bam Margera. On June 15, 2006, Yahoo! released the first official teaser for the movie.[8] The stunts in the trailer included Knoxville riding a "rocket bike" off a ramp and a blindfolded Knoxville being rammed by a yak. The film was released on DVD on October 10, 2006 in its R-rated version in full and widescreen, and in widescreen in the unrated version.[9] Jackass Number Two opened on September 22, 2006 in 3,900 screens at 3,059 theaters.

The New York Times awarded Jackass Number Two a Critic's Pick, calling it "Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies".[11] On Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper and guest critic Fred Willard gave Jackass Number Two a "Two Thumbs Up" rating.[citation needed] The soundtrack was released on September 26, 2006 by Bulletproof Records.
