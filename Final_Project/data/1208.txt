The Honeymooners is a 2005 American family comedy film directed by John Schultz. Unlike the original television series of the same name, this version stars an African American cast featuring Cedric the Entertainer, Gabrielle Union, Mike Epps, and Regina Hall. The film was panned by critics; Roger Ebert was one of the few to give it a positive review.[2][3]
