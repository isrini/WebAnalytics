Peteâ€™s parents are killed, but Pete survives and is chased into the forest by a pack of wolves. He is rescued by a dragon with green fur, yellow eyes, and huge wings. Pete names the dragon "Elliot" after his favorite book about a puppy of the same name, and takes to him as a father figure.Six years later in 1983, Pete, now 11, spots a lumberjack crew chopping down trees near his home. Natalie, the daughter of the site foreman, spots and chases him. When Natalie accidentally falls from a tree, her screams attract her father Jack and his girlfriend, park ranger Grace Meacham. Pete tries to run away, but Gavin, Jack's brother, accidentally knocks him unconscious. After realizing that Pete has vanished, Elliot stumbles around looking for him and ends up knocking over a tree near the lumber camp, leading Gavin to organize a hunting party to find him. Meanwhile, Pete wakes up in a local hospital, which he escapes in an effort to return to the forest. Before the police can catch the boy, Grace finds Pete and convinces him to come to her house by promising to take him to the forest the next day.Gavin and his men locate Pete and Elliot's treehouse, but when they try to search it, Elliot reveals himself and scares them away.
