McCanick had its theater release on March 21, 2014.[1][2]   Eugene "Mack" McCanick (David Morse) is a detective who, along with partner Floyd Intrator (Mike Vogel), hunts down a young criminal named Simon Weeks (Cory Monteith) who was just released from prison. The film has met with extremely negative reception since its release, earning a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes. Steve Pulaski of Influx Magazine gave the film a middling C-, stating, "Josh C. Waller’s McCanick is a foul-mouthed action film that will either serve as basic entertainment for some or no entertainment for others."
