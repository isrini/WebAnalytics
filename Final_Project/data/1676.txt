A fearful Shiloh runs into the kitchen since he is still scared of Judd. Marty's sister, Becky (Liberty Smith), embarrasses her mother, Louise (Ann Dowd), when she calls Judd the meanest man since Judd says he has eaten dead squirrels all his life. Soon, Marty hears from his two best friends, David Howard (Jordan Garrett) and Samantha Wallace (Taylor Momsen), that after a fist fight, a drunken Judd has been charged with murder. Marty brings Judd some squirrel stew and offers to help Judd, believing that he hasn't committed murder. Soon after, when Marty is helping Judd build a fence for his hunting dogs, Judd accidentally steps on one of his dog's paws. The dog starts attacking Judd, biting his good leg. Judd doesn't show any fear, grabbing the dog and swinging him at a fence. Afterwards, when Dara Lynn (Kyle Chavarria), another of Marty's sisters, falls into a lake, Marty jumps in to save her. Shiloh jumps in to help but gets caught in the current, which leads toward Miller Falls. Marty goes back into the lake to save Shiloh but gets caught in a branch. Seeing this, Judd jumps off a cliff into the lake to free Marty. Marty explains to Judd that Shiloh is going to go over the waterfall unless he saves him. Judd saves Shiloh and begins a friendship with Marty and Shiloh. The film ends with Marty saying, "If you open your heart, anything is possible."
