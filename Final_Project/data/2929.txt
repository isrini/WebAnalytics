Art Machine is a 2012 film by writer/director Doug Karr starring Joseph Cross, Jessica Szohr, and Joey Lauren Adams. At age six, child prodigy painter Declan Truss was propelled into the art world as a rare marvel, but by seventeen, the tightrope of notoriety is catching up with him. Declan seeks inspiration as the immense pressures of an impending coming-of-age exhibition loom. His world expands when he stumbles on a commune of rebellious freethinkers. Declan reaches beyond painting to wild experimentation, quickly spinning out of control. As he becomes consumed by his mania, he begins to regard his family as part of a system that’s keeping him down, and magnetically rallies the rebels to take part in his progressively subversive art exhibition—one that will ultimately shock and destroy. Set against the backdrop of Brooklyn’s vibrant art and music scene, Art Machine is a dark comedy about the tenuous relationship between art and commerce, the fine line between creative genius and clinical mania, and the damaging effects of fame. The film was produced by Pie Face Pictures in association with Sundial Pictures.
