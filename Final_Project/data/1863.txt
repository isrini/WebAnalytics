The Girl in the Park is a 2007 drama film by David Auburn, who makes his directorial debut here after having written the films Proof in 2005 and The Lake House in 2006. It stars Sigourney Weaver, Kate Bosworth and Keri Russell, among others.Enduringly traumatized by the disappearance of her 3-year-old daughter 16 years ago, Julia Sandburg (Weaver) has cut herself off from anyone once near and dear to her, including her husband Doug and her son Chris, who tried for years to penetrate her wall of isolation and despair, without success. But when Julia meets Louise (Bosworth), a troubled young woman with a checkered past, all of Julia's old psychological wounds painfully resurface, as does her illogical and increasingly irrational hope that Louise may be the daughter she lost so long ago.
