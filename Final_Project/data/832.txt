The Real Cancun is a 2003 American reality film directed by Rick de Oliveira and written by Brian Caldirola. Inspired by the reality television genre, this film followed the lives of sixteen Americans from March 13–23, 2003 as they celebrated spring break in Cancún, Mexico and experienced romantic relationships, emotional strife, or just had a good time.[2] The film received negative critical reviews and was a box office flop, earning a little over $5 million in the United States from a $7.5 million budget.[1] Most of the film's cast returned to general obscurity after release, with the exception of Laura Ramsey, who launched an acting career.   Some early media reports suggested that this film was a theatrical spin-off of The Real World reality series, also produced by Bunim-Murray Productions, but in fact there was no direct link between the two productions. The Real Cancun was released theatrically only a month after filming was completed,[2] and was released on DVD and home video only a couple of months after that,[3] marking one of the fastest turnarounds ever from production to theatrical release to home video. The movie is also notable as one of the first American mainstream, major studio releases to show non-simulated intercourse between "cast members", although nothing explicit is shown on screen. The DVD release contained additional footage, but the producers chose not to include any explicitly pornographic images. The film earned $2,108,796 in its opening weekend from 2,261 venues, ranking tenth in the North American box office and fourth among the week's new releases.[4] It closed a month later, having grossed $3,825,421 domestically and $1,519,662 overseas for a worldwide total of $5,345,083, coming well short of its $7.5 million production cost.[1] The Real Cancun received generally negative reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 35% score based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's consensus states: "The footage is predictable and rather tame, and most of the people are uninteresting."[5] Metacritic reports a 34 out of 100 rating based on 24 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[6] Film director Michael Tully argued that the timing of the film's release during the U.S. invasion of Iraq makes the film's depiction of young American hedonism "one of the more unintentionally brilliant statements of hypocrisy of the decade" and the film itself "a disturbingly relevant historical document".[7] The film was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie (All Concept/No Content) at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards. It lost Worst Picture to Gigli and Worst Excuse to The Cat in the Hat.
