Leslie Wright (Queen Latifah) is a straight-shooting physical therapist and die-hard basketball fan who is tired of being a guy's best friend or as Morgan called her the "homegirl" type. She and her god-sister, Morgan (Paula Patton), are living together; Morgan dreams of becoming an NBA trophy wife.After a New Jersey Nets basketball game, Leslie helps star player Scott McKnight (Common), at a gas station. He offers to open her door for her, but the task proves difficult as the door to her old car is stiff and hard to open. She has a dent in the side of her door that she refuses to get fixed because her grandfather gave her the car and he had a dimple in his left cheek just like the car. He invites her to his birthday party, where she shows up with Morgan. He meets Morgan and suddenly takes an interest in her. After a quick relationship, Scott proposes to her.At the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, Scott suffers an injury that could possibly ruin his career (along with the rumor explained below). Morgan suggests that he enlist the help of Leslie, since she did not approve of his previous gorgeous physical therapist, so Leslie moves into their home. Rumors circle that Scott's career would end quickly if he did not recover by the playoffs, which causes Morgan to leave Scott through a letter.Scott becomes extremely upset, discouraged to continue recovery. Leslie encourages him and helps him get back in the game, the two of them spending a lot of time together. Scott is able to return to the NBA right before the playoffs, winning his first game back. Leslie and Scott decide to spend a romantic evening together, but Leslie wakes up to Morgan at Scott's door hoping to reconcile. Leslie quickly moves out as Scott and Morgan reunite. Because Leslie helped Scott recover in such a short amount of time, many teams offered her the position as an athletic trainer. Most likely to make the Sixers her new team, Scott quickly stops her when he realizes that he is in love with her. They are shown a year later, with Leslie working as one of the Nets team athletic trainers and she and Scott are now married.
