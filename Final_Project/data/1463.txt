The Dog Problem is a 2006 comedy film directed and written by Scott Caan and produced by Thousand Words Films. Along with Caan, the film stars Giovanni Ribisi, Lynn Collins, Kevin Corrigan, Sarah Shahi, and Mena Suvari. Don Cheadle appears in an uncredited role. Musician Steve Jones, supermodels Joanna Krupa and Melissa Keller, and Ultimate Fighters Tito Ortiz and Kimo Leopoldo provide supporting roles.   Solo Harrington (Ribisi) is a down-on-his-luck writer who is encouraged by his psychiatrist (Cheadle) to get a dog. Solo does, and then meets Lola (Collins) at a dog play park, becoming romantically interested in her, but a series of problems stand in their way. The Dog Problem was screened at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. Erik Childress of eFilmCritic.com says it is, "A romantic comedy which doesn't force its charm down your throat and instead allows the viewer in to peek around its quirks and discover the true heart beating within."[1] The film features a score by Mark Mothersbaugh, and the music used during the title sequence is based on the Devo song "Gut Feeling".
