Irish Jam is a 2006 comedy film starring Eddie Griffin. The plot centred on an African American who wins an Irish public house in a raffle, and has to save the village from the clutches of an evil landlord. Despite the bulk of the film being set in Ireland it was not filmed there, nor were the actors Irish, but English. The film was poorly received in the UK. In its review of the DVD release, Empire called it a "worst possible Eddie Murphy knock-off" and questioned why would Ireland still have had an evil aristocratic English landlord in 2006, noting it was filmed in Cornwall because, presumably, any attempts to mount stereotypes this broad, in Ireland, would have seriously offended the people of Ireland.
