Go for Sisters is a 2013 buddy road-trip movie, written and directed by John Sayles. The title refers to the history of friendship between the two main characters: when they were in high school, the two African American women were so close they could "go for sisters".[1] Sayles shot the film in 19 days, using 65 locations, for under a million dollars. The DVD was released in August 2014 and features a Directory Commentary in which Sayles goes on at length about the art and craft of guerrilla film making.Bernice (Lisa Gay Hamilton) is a tough, no-nonsense parole officer whose son has gone missing. Fontayne (Yolonda Ross) is her old high school buddy whose brush with a possible parole violation lands her case on Bernice's desk. When Bernice discovers that her son is a possible murder suspect, she enlists Fontayne in a quest to rescue her son from what turns out to be Drug Lords and a Chinese Snakehead. Before they cross the border into Tijuana and Mexicali, Bernice also enlists the help of Freddy Suarez (Edward James Olmos), a disgraced myopic ex-cop, whose nickname used to be "The Terminator".As the story unfolds, Mahershala Ali, Isaiah Washington and Harold Perrineau each deliver brief but plot-twisting cameos.
