According to Dread Central, the producers claim the film will "introduce the accurate mythological concept of the jinn to Western audiences".
In the Beginning, Three were Created...
Man made of Clay.
Angels made of Light.
And a Third...made of Fire.
From the beginning, stories of angels and men have captured our imaginations and have been etched into our history crossing all boundaries of culture, religion, and time. These two races have dominated the landscape of modern mythology for countless centuries, almost washing away the evidence that a third ever existed. This third race, born of smokeless fire, was called the jinn. Similar to humans in many ways, the jinn lived invisibly among us and only under dire or unusual circumstances were our paths ever meant to cross.
As humans became the dominant force on Earth, contact between man and jinn steadily decreased.
Modern man has all but forgotten the jinn.[1]In 1901, a man enters a forest and comes to encounter an abandon shack with the jinn sitting and waiting on the man. He started to recite a prayer and the jinn attacks him. The man, Jehamgir Amin, tries to grab the bottle of holy water but drops it and the jinn pulls him into the hole. The man climbs his way out and as the jinn attacks him he throws the holy water on it and it retreats. The jinn swears vengeance and curses the man's family down through the generations. The man and the jinn charge at each other and the screen goes to black.A 113 years later, Shawn and Jasmine are a happy couple living in California. Shawn gets a delivery, an early birthday present of a note and VHS tape. While receiving the tape he looks over to his neighbors apartment and sees a figure staring out of the window waving at them. Later in the day Shawn tells his wife about how excited he was to design his own car and how his boss was giving him a raise. He tells her that he thinks they're ready to have their first child, but Jasmine tells him that it's impossible for her to have children. Sad over the realization, Shawn leaves to go think.Shawn is parked in a parking lot, and trying to decide on whether to say something to Jasmine or not.
