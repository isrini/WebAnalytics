She hates Connecticut and the bullying she is subjected to by Ashley and her friends because Ashley's brother is interested in her. During that time, Cat admits her earlier experience with Ashley.

As she and Willie leave to save their grandparents, everyone applauds Sydney giving Ashley what she deserved. Willie tosses the antidote in the pool and Gene and Cat jump in. At the end of the movie, Gene asks Cat to marry him again after their crazy experience.
