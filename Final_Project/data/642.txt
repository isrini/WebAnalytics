The Truth About Charlie is a 2002 American-French film. It is a remake of Charade (1963) and an homage to Fran√ßois Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player (1960) complete with the French film's star, Charles Aznavour, making two surreal appearances singing his song "Quand tu m'aimes" (first in French, later in English). The film was produced, directed and co-written by Jonathan Demme, and stars Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton in the roles once played by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade.
