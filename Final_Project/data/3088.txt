A Late Quartet (released in Australia as Performance) is a 2012 American film co-written, with Seth Grossman, and directed by Yaron Zilberman starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christopher Walken, Catherine Keener, Mark Ivanir and Imogen Poots.[3][4] The film premiered in the Special Presentation program at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was theatrically released in over 30 countries.[5] It was a New York Times Critics' Pick which Stephen Holden called a magnificently acted, "deeply felt, musically savvy film".[6] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers called it "a shining gem of a movie"[7] and Roger Ebert said "it does one of the most interesting things any film can do. It shows how skilled professionals work."[8] On Walken's performance, Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said "you won't see a better piece of acting this year than his final speech."[9]As the Fugue String quartet approaches its 25th anniversary, the onset of a debilitating illness to cellist Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken), forces its members to reevaluate their relationships. After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Peter announces his decision to play one final concert before he retires. Meanwhile the second violinist, Robert (Philip Seymour Hoffman), voices his desire to alternate the first violinist role, long held by Daniel (Mark Ivanir). Robert is married to Juliette (Catherine Keener), the viola player of the group. Upon discovering Juliette does not support him in this matter, Robert has a one-night stand. Further complicating matters, their daughter, Alexandra (Imogen Poots), begins an affair with Daniel, whom her mother once pined for. Yet bound together by their years of collaboration, the quartet will search for a fitting farewell to their shared passion of music and perhaps even a new beginning.
