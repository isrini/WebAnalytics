Moonshine is a 2006 film written and directed by Roger Ingraham. It was chosen to screen at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2006. It was made on a $9,700 budget including the purchase of a 24p digital camera (Panasonic DVX100). Pre-production took around two years. The film was Roger Ingraham's first, and is a vampire story based in his hometown of Stafford Springs, Connecticut. Production was 22 days long, with the film containing many landmarks of Stafford. The budget was kept so low largely in part due to the help of the locals, with many citizens of Stafford helping by donating cars for car crash scenes, and with even the town police helping out with the movie. The film's plot revolves around the disconnection of the protagonist as he suffers the cancer of his mother and the paralysis of his father. After taking a tedious, dead-end job with a chain-smoking manager who regards her employees with disdain, the protagonist eventually takes matters into his own hands, and falls into a horrific chain of events he never thought possible.
