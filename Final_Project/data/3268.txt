The Cloth is a 2013 American horror/thriller film that was written and directed by Justin Price, who based it upon his book of the same title.[1] The film stars Danny Trejo, Eric Roberts, Rachele Brooke Smith, Kyler Williett, and Steven Brand.[2][3] Filming took place in 2011 and was in post production as of early 2012.[4]"The Cloth" of the title, on which the story centers, is a secret organization which the Roman Catholic Church forms to counteract the rising number of cases of demonic possessions across the country. The story follows a young man (Kyler Willett) who, though he is godless, is recruited into The Cloth to prepare a new generation with the tools needed to stop the rise of Beezlebub, the ultimate evil.[6] The Cloth has found, much to the dismay of its members, that devout believers lack the capabililty for providing such tools, and thus that it needs an agent who refuses to believe in a god or gods to provide it with them.
