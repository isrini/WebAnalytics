Full Frontal is a 2002 film by Steven Soderbergh about a day in the life of a handful of characters in Hollywood. It stars Catherine Keener, Blair Underwood, David Duchovny, Julia Roberts, Mary McCormack, Brad Pitt, and David Hyde Pierce. The film was shot on digital video using the Canon XL-1s in under a month. The film blurs the line between what is real and what is fiction in its depiction of a film within a film (and possibly within another). It is in the loose structural style and narrative ambiguity of the French New Wave, and it received critical notice for this style.    Full Frontal had a limited release in the US on August 2, 2002, opening in 208 theaters and earning $739,834 its first weekend.[1]  It received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 38% based on reviews from 142 critics, with the site's consensus: An  [sic] confusing movie made worse by the poor camera work.[2] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert called Full Frontal "a film so amateurish that only the professionalism of some of the actors makes it watchable".[3] Richard Roeper also gave the film a poor review, writing that it was "like the 'Special Features' disc of the DVD without the original movie".[4] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, recommending it for its "humor and talented cast".[5]
