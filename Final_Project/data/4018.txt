The Disappointments Room is a 2016 American psychological horror film directed by D. J. Caruso, written by Wentworth Miller, and starring Kate Beckinsale and Mel Raido as a couple in a new house that contains a hidden room with a dark, haunted past.Looking for a fresh start after the death of their infant daughter, Dana and David, together with their 5-year-old son Lucas, move into their dream house, a once-grand, now run-down[4] rural home. When frightening and unexplainable events lead Dana to discover the long lost key to a room in the attic, she accidentally unlocks a host of horrors that reveal that the houseâ€™s past is terrifyingly tied with her own. A town historian tells Dana that houses of the well to do often had a "disappointments room" where children with special needs or deformities would be isolated so as not to embarrass the family. Dana uncovers the shocking story of a judge whose daughter was kept in such a room in her house and the spirits of both the deformed girl and the monstrous judge still linger. Dana begins to question her own sanity, after the spirits threaten her son.
