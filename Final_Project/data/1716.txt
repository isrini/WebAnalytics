Swarm of the Snakehead is a 2006 comedy/horror feature film directed by Frank A. Lama and Joel C. Denning and written by Seth Hurwitz. It is the first feature from producers Lama and Hurwitz's Baltimore-based production company Ten Pound Films. The ensemble cast includes Gunnar Hansen (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre), Rigg Kennedy (Slumber Party Massacre) and Miss Maryland Teen USA 2006 Jamie O'Brien. Swarm of the Snakehead was shot on 16 mm film in and around Easton, Maryland between 2002 and 2005. Post-production was completed during the summer of 2006. A rough cut of the film was premiered for friends and family at The Charles Theatre in Baltimore (where John Waters premiered many of his early films) on June 21, 2006. The sold out screening led to several articles in Maryland papers including The Baltimore Sun, as well as radio and television appearances. During one such appearance on the Baltimore CBS affiliate WJZ-TV, anchor and longtime Maryland personality Marty Bass called Swarm of the Snakehead "lots of fun" and "John Waters-esque." While making Swarm of the Snakehead, Lama starred in Fear of Clowns released by Lions Gate Entertainment in 2005 and the upcoming Fear of Clowns 2, which he also produced. At the same time, Hurwitz edited Swarm and shepherded the film through post-production, working closely with sound designer Kevin Hill and composer Tom Alonso. The original score was composed and conducted by Tom Alonso and features players from the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Bands contributing songs to the soundtrack include Kip Winger, Ravyns, Bootcamp, Glen Nevous, Tony Sciuto of Little River Band, The Big Sky, and Dagmar and the Seductones.
