Zig Zag is a 2002 film directed by David S. Goyer, based on the 1999 novel by Landon J. Napoleon.[1]Dean Singer (John Leguizamo) has terminal cancer, yet is determined to spend his last days taking care of his 15-year-old 'big brother program' autistic protégé, Louis 'Zig Zag' Fletcher. Dean got Louis a dishwasher job in shamelessly abusive, exploiting Mr. 'The Toad' Walters' (Oliver Platt) restaurant. Louis' dead-beat, neglecting yet abusive dad pushes him for 'rent' (actually to repay violent loan-shark Cadillac Tom), which Zig Zag gets by – stealing from Walters' safe, remembering numbers being his only talent. Singer is determined to return the money, despite excessive risks, with surprising allies.
