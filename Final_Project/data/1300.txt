The Sisters is a 2005 film starring Maria Bello, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Erika Christensen as the title characters; it also stars Alessandro Nivola, Rip Torn, Eric McCormack, Steven Culp, Tony Goldwyn and Chris O'Donnell. The film was written by Richard Alfieri (based on his own play)[2] and directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman. The Sisters is inspired by Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters . It tells the story of three sisters and a brother, their family dysfunctions, and the siblings dealing with their ups and downs after the death of their father.   The fourteen reviews at Metacritic were "mixed or average";[4] at Rotten Tomatoes, 18 of 26 T-Meter critics rated it rotten.[5] The Los Angeles Times called it a "pompous, overwrought and itchingly claustrophobic psychodrama", saying "nothing can save the actors from the painfully mannered dialogue and implausible relationships."[6] The New York Times said the film "ladles out almost two hours' worth of carping, backstabbing and egomania" which prompts the viewer to "quickly realize no one in this film is anyone you would want to spend two hours with" and "wonder why the heck they're spending so much time with one another."[2]
