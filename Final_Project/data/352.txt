Murder on a Sunday Morning (French: Un coupable id√©al) is a documentary film directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade. Its subject is the Brenton Butler case, a criminal case in which a fifteen-year-old boy was wrongfully accused of murder. The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002.[1] Brenton Butler was arrested and tried for the 2000 murder of a tourist in Jacksonville, Florida. The prosecution's case relied heavily upon a positive identification made by the victim's husband, and on Butler's confession, which the teen claimed was coerced. The film follows Butler's defense team building their case for his innocence.
