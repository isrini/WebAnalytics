I'm Not Ashamed is a 2016 biographical drama film based on the journals of Rachel Scott, the first victim of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Columbine, Colorado. Scott is the main protagonist, and the story of both gunmen who committed the shooting, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, is intertwined with Scott's.[4][5]   The producers of the film accused YouTube of an anti-Christian bias for blocking the official trailer of I'm Not Ashamed for 11 months.[6][7] Reportedly, the video sharing site had repeatedly removed the trailer for the movie without offering any valid explanation.[8] At least one author and some sections of the media[9] question the actual circumstances surrounding Rachel Scott's final moments.[10] However, according to some sources, the final and fatal wound Rachel received was inflicted after Eric Harris approached her as she and Richard Castaldo lay wounded; he lifted Rachel's head by her hair, before asking whether she believed in the existence of the Lord, to which she replied, "You know I do." In response, Harris replied, "Well, go be with Him", before shooting Rachel in the temple.[11] Richard Castaldo, the student shot directly alongside Rachel and who only survived the attack by feigning death before falling into unconsciousness, later recalled hearing Rachel weeping as she curled into a ball upon the grass, before hearing a final gunshot as Harris and Klebold approached them.[12] The film opened in 505 theaters on October 21, 2016, and played at 516 theaters in its widest release.[3] Its lifetime box-office take was $2,082,980.[3] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 22%, based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10.[13] On Metacritic, the film received a score of 31 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews."[14] The Guardian rated the film 2 stars out of 5, with their justification being: "To use the senseless death of a school shooting victim to promote one's warped political agenda is, to use a trendy term, deplorable."[15] The A.V. Club gave it a D+, stating their belief the film is "just another vehicle for a series of scenes in which devout characters remind each other that God has it all under control" and that "the political implications are very unsavory".[16] The Los Angeles Times gave a mixed review, noting that while there was "...a refreshing lack of moralizing here, and a welcome emphasis on accepting people for who they are," they felt that "the forced ironies of having infamous teen mass-murderers interact with the heroine feels more than a little exploitative." [17] The film did receive some positive reviews. Plugged In Online, a review site owned by Focus on the Family, gave a positive review of the film, saying: "Rachel Joy Scott's story is a moving example of the difference just one committed Christian can make in the lives of people around her." [18] Luke Y. Thompson, writing as a contributor for Forbes magazine said, "...with its pro-compassion message and likable lead, I'm Not Ashamed is a faith-based movie worthy of some praise."[19]
