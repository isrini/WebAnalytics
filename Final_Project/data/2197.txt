Proud American is a 2008 biographical drama film released by Slowhand Cinema in both conventional 35mm and IMAX format. It features five stories that intend to capture the essence of the American spirit, two of them chronicling the founding of Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola. The film holds the distinction of having obtained additional funding through overt sponsorship of the two companies, as well as MasterCard and American Airlines, whose product placement can be observed throughout the film.[2]   The film has not been well-received financially. Opening in 750 theaters, Proud American managed to earn only $96,076, or $128 per venue â€” making it the lowest-grossing wide release in movie history.[3][4] The film was panned by critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 10%, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 2.9/10.[5]
