The Singles Ward is a 2002 LDS cinema comedy film directed by Kurt Hale written by himself and John E. Moyer, based on his own life as a standup comedian and single member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Like The R.M., and other films which followed it, The Singles Ward's target audience is members of the LDS Church and citizens of Utah.After faithfully serving a full-time mission for the LDS Church and marrying, Jonathan Jordan finds himself divorced and once again a member of the LDS single adult world, where the ultimate goal is Eternal Marriage. Disenchanted, Jordan stops going to church. He even creates a standup routine lampooning the Mormon lifestyle. His resistance to the church continues until he falls for Cammie Giles, a member of the local singles ward. Suddenly, Jordan finds going to church more appealing. But is he attending church again just to impress her?During the course of the movie, Jonathan frequently breaks the fourth wall to narrate events to the audience.
