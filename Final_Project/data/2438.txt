Powder Blue is a 2008 American drama film with an ensemble cast featuring several interconnected story arcs. It was written and directed by Timothy Linh Bui, and features Patrick Swayze's last film role before his death the following year. The film saw only limited theatrical release in the USA and was ultimately released principally on DVD in May 2009. The film was subsequently released in Kazakhstan and Russia and on US cable television premium movie channels in late 2009.   Several Los Angeles residents meet on Christmas Eve through chance, tragedy, loss and divine intervention. Patrick Swayze plays the sleazy owner of the strip club where Jessica Biel's character dances. Biel's character, Rose-Johnny, is a dancer and single mother whose young son is in a coma. Eddie Redmayne portrays a young mortician who falls in love with her. Kris Kristofferson plays the head of a corporate crime organization who tries to convince his former employee (Ray Liotta) not to seek vengeance on his co-workers. Liotta's character later reveals to Rose-Johnny that he is her father. Forest Whitaker, who also serves as a producer on the film, is a suicidal ex-priest. Alejandro Romero plays a transvestite prostitute who shares an unexpected emotional bond with the priest.[2] The cast includes the following:[3] According to Variety magazine, "the heartstring-pulling contrivances of the film, set during Christmastime, go way over the top...Biel often overacts even more than her role requires."[4] The magazine calls director Bui's "trumpeting of the power of love in the city of lonely hearts ... both ear-splittingly loud and tone-deaf at the same time" with "Jonathan Sela's color palette of nightmarish reds and blues and blinding whites, simply enforc[ing] the pic's borderline hysteria." Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 25% rating from eight critic reviews with an average rating of 3.7 out of 10."[5]
