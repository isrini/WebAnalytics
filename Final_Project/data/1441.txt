Gus likes to tell half-true stories about all the girls he has slept with and all the drugs he has done. Jessica is seventeen too. She seems not to have much in common with anyone anymore â€“ not even her best friend Christie.Every year Brian throws a 4th of July party. The party is never great, but there is free beer, so people always go. Gus and Jessica meet each other there. They watch fireworks outside and light sparklers. Gus says that he is not the sort of guy she thinks he is. He tells her a secret he has never told anyone before.
