Adventures in Wild California is a 70mm American documentary film showcasing the scenery and extreme sports found in California. It is narrated by Golden Globe-winning actor Jimmy Smits and was released to IMAX theaters in 2000. The film is directed by Academy Award-nominated director and cinematographer Greg MacGillivray. California's geography and culture - which the film asserts inspires people to take chances, is the focus of the documentary. Extreme sports such as sky diving and surfing are captured with dramatic aerial free-fall and underwater photography, while examples such as Walt Disney's creation of an entertainment empire based on a "little mouse", the construction of the Golden Gate bridge during the Great Depression, and the establishment of high-tech Silicon Valley showcase the risk-taking California inspires.
