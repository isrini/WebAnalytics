Stevie is a 2002 film by documentarian Steve James, and Kartemquin Films.   In 1995, James returned to Pomona, a rural town in Southern Illinois, USA. After 10 years with no contact he attempts to reconnect with Stevie Fielding, a troubled young boy to whom he had been an 'Advocate Big Brother'. James's re-entry into Stevie's life is brief. The story then picks up again about two years later after Stevie is charged with a serious crime. Through interviews with Stevie and his family and friends, James paints the portrait of a man who is still very troubled while he tries to understand what led Stevie down the path of self-destruction. Stevie was the winner of numerous festival awards, including the 2002 Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival's Joris Ivens Award, given to that year's top documentary.[1] The film was a 2003 nominee for Best Documentary at the Sundance FIlm Festival, as well as the Independent Spirit Awards.[2][3] By decade's end, Stevie was on numerous 'Best of the 2000s' list. In his list of 'Best Films of Any Genre', Ray Pride of NewCity Film, ranked Stevie at #19.[4][5][6] Critic Collin Souter of Efilmcritic.com named Stevie the best documentary of the decade.[7][not in citation given] Stephen Fielding was scheduled to be paroled on February 15, 2007.
