The Yes Men, is a 2003 documentary film about the early culture jamming exploits of The Yes Men. The film revolves around "The Yes Men"—two anti-globalization activists, under the aliases Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno—who impersonate spokespeople for the WTO and affiliated corporations, in order to secretly lampoon and satirize these organizations with elaborate ruses and fraudulent announcements of ridiculous corporate decisions, in front of live, unsuspecting audiences (usually comprising businesspeople, university student bodies, and/or the press). The film details the two activists' involvement in hoaxes targeting SimCopter, the 2000 G. W. Bush presidential campaign, McDonald's, and, most prominently, the WTO. The film also includes brief interviews with Michael Moore and Greg Palast. The film premiered at the 28th Toronto International Film Festival in 2003. It was also shown as part of a special screening at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. The film received a score of 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is followed by a sequel, The Yes Men Fix the World.
