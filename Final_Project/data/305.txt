Herman U.S.A. is a 2001 American romantic comedy directed by Bill Semans.   In a small Minnesota town, seventy-eight bachelor farmers advertise for companionship, leading to a response far outstripping expectations. Herman U.S.A. was filmed in a real small town in Minnesota called New Germany. The crew painted over the water tower to read "Herman U. S. A." The town of Herman, Minnesota did not have enough hotel space to fit the entire cast and crew members.
