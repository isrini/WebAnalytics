Critical reception has been mixed,[2] with many of the reviewers commenting that the film would not appeal to all audiences.[3] HorrorNews.net gave a mixed review for Blood for Irina, calling it an "immersive experience" while also criticizing the director's choice to have minimal dialogue, as it "really makes [the story] hard to follow after a while".[4] In contrast, Diabolique Magazine gave a more favorable review for the movie, saying that it "may not appeal to every type of horror fan, but those versed in artsy European vampire films, or those at least curious, should find plenty to appreciate here."[5] In 2013 Alexander announced his intent to film a sequel to Blood for Irina, which would be titled Queen of Blood.[6] Shauna Henry will reprise her role as Irina and the film will also feature Nivek Ogre.[7] The movie is set in the Wild West and it released on 13 August 2014 at the Montreal HorrorFest.[7]
