A Christmas Story 2 (also known in the trailer as A Christmas Story 2: Official Sequel) is a 2012 film directed by Brian Levant and starring Braeden Lemasters.[1] The film is a direct sequel to the 1983 film A Christmas Story, which ignores the events of the 1994 film My Summer Story. It was released straight to DVD on October 30, 2012.[2]The film takes place six years after the events of the first film, which took place in 1940. Ralphie is now fifteen years old, and all he wants is a used 1939 Mercury Eight convertible for Christmas. He accidentally causes the car to roll back out of the used car lot and gently tap a light pole, causing a plastic reindeer on the pole to loosen and fall through the convertible top, so he bands together with Flick and Schwartz to raise enough money to pay the dealer back for fixing it before Christmas so that the car dealer won't have Ralphie arrested and presumably thrown in jail (he would have to go to court and be found guilty first and even then jail is probably unlikely). He and his friends get a job and after going through several departments at the Higbee's store and in the end getting into a fight with the store Santa and then each other they all get fired. Ralphie does get his job back after begging and demanding so he does raise the money but donates a chunk for a less fortunate family. He winds up still off the hook with the owner of the dealership. In the end he does get the car he wants for Christmas and the girlfriend he wants to go with it.
