Just Before I Go, previously entitled Hello I Must Be Going,[3] is a 2014 black comedy drama film[4] directed by Courteney Cox, in her directorial debut, from a screenplay written by David Flebotte, starring Seann William Scott, Elisha Cuthbert, Olivia Thirlby, Garret Dillahunt, and Kate Walsh. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 24, 2014,[5] and it was released in select theaters on April 24, 2015.[6]   Ted Morgan decides to commit suicide; but before he goes, he returns to his hometown to settle some scores. Things don't go as planned. As of July 10, 2013, filming was under way in Los Angeles.[7] The premiere took place at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival.[5] The film was released in select theaters on April 24, 2015 before a video on demand, digital store, DVD and Blu-ray release on May 12, 2015.[6] Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 10% of 10 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 1.9/10.[8] Metacritic rated it 24/100 based on six reviews.[9] Justin Chang of Variety called it "a dismal, tonally disastrous small-town farce".[1] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter described it as "a serious misfire" whose tonal shifts would be difficult for a veteran director to manage.[10] Ethan Alter of Film Journal International wrote, "Cox must have seen something in this screenplay that encouraged her to film it, but whatever that critical element was, itâ€™s not apparent in the finished product."[11] Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film "lurches along a wobbly line between salacious comic nastiness and nauseating sentimentality" without properly integrating them into a cohesive whole.[12] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News wrote: "Courteney Cox's misbegotten project is a comedy-drama that, to Cox's credit, doesn't feel at all like a TV sitcom. The former "Friends" star clearly wanted something special, but sadly the result is ... this."[13] Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "Anchored by a nicely understated performance by Seann William Scott, Just Before I Go effectively juggles a wealth of genuine, at times profound, emotion with quite a bit of nutty-raunchy humor."[14]
