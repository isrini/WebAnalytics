Evidence is a 2012 American found footage horror film directed and edited by Howie Askins and produced and written by Ryan McCoy, who also stars in the movie.[1] The film also stars Brett Rosenberg, Abigail Richie, and Ashley Bracken.[2]   Ryan is making a documentary on his friend, Brett, about camping for the first time. However, once they begin camping, they discover that there is a mysterious figure that is hunting them. Askins began developing Evidence in January 2010 after viewing Paranormal Activity and began shooting the film in April of the same year.[3] The film was shot in chronological order and the production cost $12,000 to make in its entirety.[3] Critical reception for Evidence has been mixed to negative,[4] with Bloody Disgusting saying it "[failed] to scare".[5] Shock Till You Drop panned the film overall, calling it a "good effort" but criticized the film's shift in tone.[6] In contrast, Dread Central gave a more positive review, giving it 3 1/2 out of 5 blades and praising the film's shift.[7] JoBlo's Arrow in the Head reviewer Matt Withers wrote that he "kinda dug it" but that "a couple of effective scares and some solid visuals aren't enough to make up for a story that makes little attempt to explain itself and drags far too often to be considered truly successful".[8] According to Ryan McCoy on a couple of interviews, a sequel is currently in the works. It is said to be both a prequel and a sequel.
