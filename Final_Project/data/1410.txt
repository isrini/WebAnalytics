He is reunited with his former sweetheart and estranged daughter, who returns to the town as well.Bo Price (Keith), a down-and-out country singer, has returned home for his brother's funeral following a military training accident. While there, he reunites with his true love, Angela Delton (Preston), a Miami news reporter who has also returned home for her brother's funeral. Bo also meets their 16-year-old daughter, Dixie Leigh Delton (Haun), for the first time. Since Bo walked away from Angela while she was still pregnant, Dixie has never met him or his side of the family.

With her father's musical blood running through her veins, Dixie closes the movie by singing a song she wrote at the memorial for the fallen soldiers.
