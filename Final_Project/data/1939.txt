During a show in an old people's home, he meets Marilyn Monroe. Haunted by her angelic beauty, he follows her to a commune in the Scottish Highlands, joining her husband Charlie Chaplin, and her daughter Shirley Temple. Here, the Pope, the Queen, Madonna, James Dean, and other impersonators build a stage in the hope that the world will visit and watch them perform.A subplot concerns a convent of nuns, in what seems to be a developing country. One of the nuns survives a fall from an airplane during a mission to deliver food to villages, and discovers that if you are true of heart, God will protect you. All the nuns then begin jumping from planes to show they are true of heart and protected by God.[3]
