The film's carnival scene was filmed at William and Lee Park in Port Allen, Louisiana.[4][5] The film received negative reviews from critics. Based on 16 reviews, it currently holds a 13% approval rating on film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.[6] The film also holds a rating of 26/100 on Metacritic based on 10 reviews indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[7] Writing for The New York Times, film critic Stephen Holden said of the film, "Hee Haw meets Pulp Fiction at the meth lab: That describes the style of Pawn Shop Chronicles, a hillbilly grindhouse yawp of a movie that belches in your face and leaves a sour stink."[8] The film was reviewed favorably by JoBlo.com. For the site, reviewer JimmyO wrote, "Pawn Shop Chronicles is a wildly bizarre and politically incorrect mix of b-movie genres wrapped into one. Kramer – with the script by Minarovich – amps up the action and violence without pushing it too far – well at least for my personally warped taste."[9]
