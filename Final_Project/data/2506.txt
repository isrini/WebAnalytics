BearCity is a 2010 American gay-themed (in particular, the gay bear community) comedy-drama film directed by Doug Langway, and written by Langway and Lawrence Ferber. It is about a young twink gay man who fantasizes about bears and his search to find the perfect man.[2] The sequel BearCity 2: The Proposal was released in the fall of 2012.[3] BearCity 3 was released for viewing at various LGBT festivals and venues in 2016, and is scheduled for full release in 2017.[4]The story revolves around Tyler (played by Joe Conti) who is an aspiring actor in his early twenties who has just moved to New York City in an attempt to jump-start his career. Tyler fits in the twink category but finds himself attracted to bears, often large-bodied and, typically, hairy men. After moving in with Fred and Brent (played by Brian Keane and Stephen Guarino, respectively) who are looking for a new roommate, Tyler realizes his expectations of sexual escapades are falling far short of what he would have liked, while simultaneously falling for Fred and Brent's muscle-bear friend named Roger (Gerald McCullouch). Roger fears judgment for being with someone from outside the community, and hesitates to introduce Tyler to his friends.
