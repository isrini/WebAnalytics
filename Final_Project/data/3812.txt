Jim White, a football coach, loses his job and moves with his family to take a new job at McFarland High School in McFarland, California, which is predominantly Latino. Discovering that some of his students are strong runners, he organizes a boys' cross country team with seven members who have little hope for their future. They become a close-knit, mutually supportive unit. Under White's guidance the team becomes outstandingly successful, winning 11 state titles over the years, with many members escaping poverty and being first in their families to go to college or into military careers. Some members continue to attend practice even after graduation from college.
