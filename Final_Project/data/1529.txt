The Heart of Steel is a documentary directed by Angelo J. Guglielmo, Jr. and had its World Premiere at The Tribeca Film Festival in May, 2006. Personally selected by festival co-founder, Jane Rosenthal, this historical film chronicles a group of ordinary citizens who volunteered in the search and rescue and cleanup efforts after the collapse of the World Trade Center following the September 11 attacks. From First Lady Laura Bush: "President Bush and I are touched by the many creative ways people across the nation have expressed their patriotism and their admiration for the heroes of September 11, 2001. Your video is a wonderful example of that creativity." From Susan Sarandon: "In an era where citizens feel helpless and are skeptical as to what kind of a difference a volunteer can really make, Heart of Steel illustrates how even just one impassioned individual can move mountains. An important message for students and patrons alike! What M*A*S*H was to the Vietnam war, The Heart of Steel is to 9/11." From David Edelstein, New York Magazine: "Touching." From Lian Dolan, Satellite Sisters, ABC Radio Networks: "The Heart of Steel is an extraordinary film about ordinary citizens. I rooted for and cried with this band of renegade volunteers who helped get New York back on its feet after 9/11. What a story! This film should be in every school, every library as a vital part of history." From Professor Heidi Ardizzone, University of Notre Dame: "This film is a gripping reflection of the wrenching contradictions of emotion and reaction to 9/11 before the politics of war and global terrorism became the dominant response."
