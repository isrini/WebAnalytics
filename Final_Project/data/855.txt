Testosterone (2003) is a film adaption from James Robert Baker's novel Testosterone. The film is directed by David Moreton and stars David Sutcliffe, Antonio Sabato, Jr., and Jennifer Coolidge.   Dean Seagrave (David Sutcliffe) is a thirty-something graphic novelist living in L.A., and though he's found personal happiness with his hot, Argentinian boyfriend, Pablo (Antonio Sabato, Jr.), he can't surmount his writer's block slump following his successful debut graphic novel, Teenage Speed Freak. His life begins to unravel when his editor, Luise (Coolidge), gives him an ultimatum, and Pablo, the sexy boyfriend, goes out for cigarettes one night and never comes back. Lonely, depressed, and at the end of his rope, Seagrave flies to Argentina in search of closure, but the characters he discovers there – Pablo's secretive and controlling Mother (Sônia Braga), Pablo's ex-lover Marcos (Leonardo Brzezicki), and Marcos' enigmatic sister Sofia (Celina Font) – conspire to prevent him from reaching Pablo. Although the setting for the story of Testosterone starts in Los Angeles, California and then moves to Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Los Angeles scenes were filmed in Buenos Aires.[1]
