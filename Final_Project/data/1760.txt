Zyzzyx Road (/zəˈzɪzɪks/ zə-ZIZ-iks), also called Zyzzyx Rd., is a 2006 American thriller film written, produced and directed by John Penney. It stars Leo Grillo, Katherine Heigl and Tom Sizemore, and involves a philandering accountant who goes to Las Vegas on a business trip, where he encounters a seductress and her jealous ex-boyfriend. The former pair kill and bury the latter along the eponymous "Zzyzx Road", a rural road off of Interstate 15 in California's Mojave Desert. (The road's name is slightly altered.) Zyzzyx Road is not associated with the similarly-named Zzyzx. The film gained notoriety from its gross ticket sales of only $30 on its opening run, due to its intentionally-limited release at a single cinema,[1] making it possibly the lowest-grossing film in U.S. history in terms of box office sales.[2]   Principal photography took place in the summer of 2005 and lasted 18 days, plus an additional two days for pickup scenes. The film was shot entirely on location in the Mojave Desert, in and around local mines.[3] Sizemore and long-time friend Peter Walton, who worked as Sizemore's assistant, were arrested during the film's production for repeatedly failing drug tests while on probation. Police discovered that Walton had a warrant out for his arrest for child pornography distribution and was subsequently jailed. Sizemore was not jailed, making it possible for him to film his scenes.[1] Zyzzyx Road was shown once a day, at noon, for six days (February 25 – March 2, 2006) at Highland Park Village Theater in Dallas, Texas,[4] a movie theater rented by the producers for $1,000.[1] The limited release was deliberate: Grillo was uninterested in releasing the film domestically until it underwent foreign distribution, but needed to fulfill the U.S. release obligation required by the Screen Actors Guild for low-budget films[1] (films with budgets less than $2.5 million that are not for the direct-to-video market).[5] The strategy had the side effect of making the film at the time the lowest-grossing film of all time, earning just $30 at the box office from six patrons.[2] Unofficially, its opening weekend netted $20. The $10 difference is due to Grillo personally refunding two tickets purchased by Sheila Moore, the film's makeup artist, who saw the film with a friend.[1] The similarly-named Zzyzx has also (mistakenly) been cited as the lowest-grossing film of all time, because of the similar titles and release dates of the films.[6] The film was released on DVD in 23 countries, including Bulgaria, Indonesia, and Portugal. By the end of 2006, the film earned around $20.[1] In the summer of 2012, six years after its original release, GoDigital released the film domestically in digital format because of its success internationally. In September 2012, the film was released on DVD in North America.
