Dolph wakes up early in the morning in his suburban home to find that his dog is missing. He is in denial that he has lost his job and shows up to his office to work every day and pretends to do his work. Dolph's need to live in a world of denial about all the areas in his life that are obviously not working is found throughout his life. A palm tree in his backyard transforms into a pine tree. It's raining inside Dolph's office even though none of his co-workers seem to notice it or care that they're being soaked. To put his life back together, he goes in search for his dog. It holds a 68% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The critical consensus states that "Wrong is strange and meandering, but its absurdist vignettes reveal a unique, wry wit." Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine did not feel that the film worked: However, Chase Whale of Twitch Film enjoyed the film: The soundtrack to Wrong was produced by Quentin Dupieux under his stage name Mr. Oizo and French electro-rock music producer David Sztanke under the name "Tahiti Boy". Track 7 and 12 were produced by Sztanke's group "Tahiti Boy & The Palmtree Family".
