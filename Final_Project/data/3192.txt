Learning Vanellope can't drive, Ralph helps teach her. King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers to him in exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope won, her glitches would likely damage the game, leading to its and her destruction. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his own game, but notices Vanellope's image on the side of the Sugar Rush cabinet, realizing she was meant to be a playable character.Elsewhere, Felix and Calhoun search Sugar Rush for Ralph.
