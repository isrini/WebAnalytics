It is the most successful film to open on Super Bowl weekend, a particularly barren spot in the winter dump months of the movie-release calendar.[4] The DVD arrived on both formats in America on August 19. The DVD, a 2-Disc Extended Edition, includes an 82-minute cut in both 2-D and 3-D viewing modes. Bonus features on both include behind-the-scenes footage with Miley Cyrus, Billy Ray, and the Jonas Brothers; a sing-along mode and "total concert immersion through 3-D viewing capability". DVD contains a Dolby 5.1 track and both full screen and anamorphic widescreen formats, while Blu-ray goes 16x9 only and delivers DTS-HD MA 7.1 surround sound, one of the first Blu-ray releases to have that specific surround sound. Recalling the successful theatrical gimmick, the home video releases were vowed to be sold "for a limited time only". The DVD and Blu-ray were released in the United Kingdom on November 3, 2008 and the DVD was released in Australia on October 8. US Sold: $134.2 million copies.
