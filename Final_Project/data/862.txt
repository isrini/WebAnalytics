Two Days is a 2003 drama film written and directed by Sean McGinly about a man (Paul Rudd) who has a film crew documenting the last two days of his life before his planned suicide. During this time, friends, former girlfriends, and his parents try to convince him to stay alive; most of them think he is merely joking or making a plea for attention. The film also stars Karl Wiedergott, Mackenzie Astin, Marguerite Moreau, Lourdes Benedicto and Donal Logue.
